# Welcome to CiscoLive 2020 Barcelona

**Utilizing Cisco CXTA service framework to validate network elements (DEVWKS-1407)**

This guide introduces the [setup](00-setup.md) of the lab environment and contains a few exercises you can try yourself on the laptops provided.  
Please use the navigation on the left to navigate.

The lab has already been started for you, so you can dive right into a first set of [basic steps](01-basic.md) which introduce Robotframework and some basic keywords to interact with Cisco routers.  
The [2nd chapter](02-parsing.md) introduces more powerful command output parsing keywords, and we are concluding with [advanced parsing exercises](03-genie.md) using Cisco's pyATS/Genie framework.

We hope you will enjoy these exercises!
